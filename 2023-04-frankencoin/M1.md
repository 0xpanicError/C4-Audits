# Vulnerability details

## Impact
The limit variable declared in StablecoinBridge.sol is an immutable value that represents the maximum amount of outstanding converted source stablecoins.
In the `mintInternal` function, the balance of collateral is checked to be less than limit before the mint takes place.
This can lead to the balance to exceed limit and break the invariant even if require passes.

## Proof of Concept
For example the limit is 1000 and balance of collateral is 900. Some can pass the value as 1000 which would pass the require as 900(balance) <= 1000(limit).
Now the function mints 1000 new tokens which increase balance to 1900 > limit which breaks the invariant.

```solidity
L49:   function mintInternal(address target, uint256 amount) internal {
L50:           require(block.timestamp <= horizon, "expired");
L51:           require(chf.balanceOf(address(this)) <= limit, "limit");
L52:           zchf.mint(target, amount);
L53:       }
```

## Tools Used
Manual Finding

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
This can be prevented by changing the require statement to:
`require(chf.balanceOf(address(this) + amount) <= limit, "limit");`
